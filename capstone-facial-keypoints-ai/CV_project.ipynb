    "Edge detection is a dimension reduction technique - by keeping only the edges of an image we get to throw away a lot of non-discriminating information.  And typically the most useful kind of edge-detection is one that preserves only the important, global structures (ignoring local structures that aren't very discriminative).  So removing local structures / retaining global structures is a crucial pre-processing step to performing edge detection in an image, and blurring can do just that.  \n",
